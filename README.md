Portfolio web page of Ricardo Soto Est√©vez. [Hosted here](https://kriogenia.github.io/sotoestevezdotric/).

The main idea behind this project is building a portfolio web easily expandable to keep it updated with any new change i would want to add like a new project or skills acquired. As so, those expandable options are right now JSON files on configs, you can easily create or update a new language or project just making an easy change on those files. If you want to fork this repository to build your own web from this one I highly encourage to, those config files go as follows: 

### Previous considerations

Right now the project is configured to be launched on the homepage specified at the package.json, you should change it there and rename it, this has an implication if you want to launch it on GitHub Pages like me. Those pages go as follow: 

```bash
https://{username}.github.io/{repository}/
```

The /{repository}/ is important as the project will always take it as the base of the public folder and therefore everything located there will need it in its path, if you look at my configs files you'll notice those paths there starts always with /{repository}/, if you will launch this on GitHub Pages, take into consideration you should do this too. In future version I will try to extract this too.

If you want to test this on your computer you will need to launch this from the root of the project:

```bash
npm start
```

#### Localization

The localization JSONs are on /public/locales, you'll need a directory with the language code for each language you want to add and place inside a translation.json with the collection of messages you will locate in the webpage.

This also needs to configure the i18n.js file on /src to specificy the name of your repository where it configures the paths.

The languages you will offer on your webpage will be changed with the icons on the navigation bar. You establish those with configs/languages.json, you need to specify a key that identify each one, the code of the language, the icon path and an alt for that icon to show in case it doesn't load.

#### Navigation bar links

You can find those on configs/navbar-options.json, you need to specify a key that identify each one, a label route from the internationalization files, the icon path if it will have one and the locale path it will lead to.

#### Social media

The Biography page offers a list of social media icons at the end of the presentation, those come from configs/social-media.json. Those will need a key, an icon and an alt like the languages, you should also specify a link to redirect to when clicking those.
